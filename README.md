**SEO + Google Ads skills for Claude Code. Data-driven decisions, not dashboards.**

Toprank gives your AI agent direct access to Google Search Console and Google Ads. It analyzes your traffic, surfaces what's hurting your rankings, finds wasted ad spend, and tells you exactly what to fix. When you have access to the repo, it goes further: rewriting meta tags, fixing headings, adding structured data, and shipping the changes.

> *"Am I wasting money on ads right now?"*
> *"Why did my traffic drop and how do I fix it?"*
> *"How do I get more conversions without spending more?"*

Free, open-source. Install in 30 seconds.

## See It Work

### Google Ads

```
You:    /toprank:ads-audit

Claude: Connected to your Google Ads account (MyStore).

        3 campaigns active. $2,400 spent this month.

        Scorecard:
        ┌──────────────────────┬──────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
        │ Dimension            │ Status   │ Summary                      │
        ├──────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
        │ Conversion tracking  │ OK       │ 3 actions firing correctly   │
        │ Keyword health       │ Critical │ 8 keywords burning cash      │
        │ Search term quality  │ Warning  │ 12 irrelevant queries        │
        │ Impression share     │ Warning  │ Losing 35% to rank           │
        │ Spend efficiency     │ Critical │ $340/mo wasted               │
        └──────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────────────────────────┘

        Top 3 actions:
        1. Pause 3 keywords ($210/mo, zero conversions)
        2. Add 12 negative keywords ($130/mo wasted on irrelevant terms)
        3. Increase bids 15% on 2 high-converting keywords losing IS

        Business context saved — /toprank:ads-copy and /toprank:ads will use it.

You:    Do it all.

        [paused 3 wasteful keywords — saved $210/mo]
        [added 12 negative keywords — saved $130/mo]
        [increased bids on 2 high-performers]

        Done. All changes are reversible within 7 days.
```

**Weekly review** — ask any time, or set it up as a recurring Coworker task:

```
You:    /toprank:ads — "review last week's changes"

Claude: 12 changes in the last 7 days. 9 matured enough to judge.

        Wins (4):
        - Paused "cheap seo services" → CTR +18%, conversions +2
        - Added "free" as negative → wasted spend -$84/wk
        - Bid +15% on "b2b crm software" → conversions +3, CPA flat
        - New RSA on "MyStore Brand" ad group → CTR +24%

        Losses (2):
        - Bid +20% on "enterprise saas" → cost +$210, conversions flat
        - Paused "project management tool" → lost 4 conversions/wk

        Too new to judge (3) — check back in 5 days.

        Note: 2 changes had other edits on the same campaign within
        7 days, so their direction is low-confidence.
```

### SEO

```
You:    /toprank:seo-analysis

Claude: Found your site at mystore.com — pulling Search Console data now.

        [90 days of real traffic data loaded]
        [pages crawled for technical issues]

        Three things hurting you most:

        Your homepage lives at two addresses. Google splits your ranking
        power between them. Easy fix.

        Two pages targeting the same search terms — they compete against
        each other and neither wins.

        One page gets 400 monthly impressions but ranks #52. The title
        doesn't match what people actually search for.

        Here's your 30-day plan, most impactful first.
```

## How It Works

Toprank is a Claude Code plugin. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with supporting reference documents, scripts, and eval tests.

## Connectors

Toprank skills reference external tools using the `~~category` placeholder pattern. This makes skills tool-agnostic — they work with any MCP server that provides the required capability.

| Category | Placeholder | Default Server | Alternatives |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Google Ads | `~~google-ads` | [AdsAgent MCP](https://www.adsagent.org) (`mcp__adsagent__*`) | Google Ads MCP (`mcp__google_ads_mcp__*`) |
| Search Console | `~~search-console` | gcloud CLI + Search Console API | Any GSC-compatible MCP server |
| CMS | `~~cms` | Direct API (WordPress REST, Strapi, Contentful, Ghost) | Any CMS MCP server |

Skills use conditional blocks based on available tools. If a connector is not available, the skill gracefully degrades — for example, `seo-analysis` can still run a technical crawl without GSC data.

**Setup:**
- **Google Ads:** See `google-ads/shared/preamble.md`. Get a free API key from [adsagent.org](https://www.adsagent.org), set `ADSAGENT_API_KEY`, and the `.mcp.json` auto-configures the MCP server.
- **Search Console:** See `seo/shared/preamble.md`. Requires Google Cloud SDK, Search Console API enabled, and OAuth login.
- **CMS:** Run `/toprank:setup-cms` to configure WordPress, Strapi, Contentful, or Ghost.

## Contributing

Each skill lives in its own folder under a category directory:

```
seo/                      <- SEO skills go here
└── your-skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md          <- required
    ├── scripts/          <- optional
    └── references/       <- optional

google-ads/               <- Google Ads skills go here
└── your-skill-name/
    └── SKILL.md          <- required
```

**SKILL.md** needs a frontmatter header with `name` and `description`, then step-by-step instructions in the imperative.

**Scripts:** Python 3.8+ stdlib only (or `requests`). Accept `--output` for file output. stderr for progress, stdout for data.

**Pull requests:** One skill per PR. Test your skill before submitting. Bump `VERSION` and update `CHANGELOG.md`.
