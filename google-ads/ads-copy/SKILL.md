## Setup

Read and follow `../shared/preamble.md` — it handles MCP detection, token, and account selection. If config is already cached, this is instant.

# Ad Copy Generator + A/B Tester

Write Google Ads RSA copy and run structured A/B tests to find winning messaging.

## Reference Documents

Before generating any copy, read these reference documents for expert-level context:

- `references/rsa-best-practices.md` — Character limits, headline formulas, pinning strategy, A/B methodology, common mistakes
- Read from ads skill: `../ads/references/industry-benchmarks.md` — Industry-specific CTR benchmarks to beat
- Read from ads skill: `../ads/references/quality-score-framework.md` — How ad copy impacts Quality Score components

These contain the specific formulas, character counts, and patterns that separate amateur ad copy from expert-level RSAs.

## Business Context — Read First, Ask Once

Every ad copy decision depends on understanding the business. Business context is stored in `{data_dir}/business-context.json`.

### On every invocation:

1. **Read `{data_dir}/business-context.json`**. If it exists and has content, use it — skip to the next section.
2. **If missing or empty**, follow the full intake procedure in `../ads-audit/references/business-context.md` (website crawl, data bootstrapping, JSON schema). That document is the single source of truth for gathering business context.
3. **If the user volunteers new info** (new service, changed positioning, seasonal update), merge it into the existing file.

### How business context shapes copy

| Field | Copy application |
|-------|-----------------|
| `services` | Determines headline categories and description angles |
| `locations` | Geo-specific headlines get higher quality scores and CTR |
| `brand_voice` | Tone, forbidden words, preferred language |
| `differentiators` | These ARE the value prop headlines — the reason someone picks you |
| `competitors` | Sharpens positioning (without naming them in ads) |
| `seasonality` | When to push urgency copy vs. evergreen |
| `social_proof` | Trust signal headlines and descriptions |
| `offers_or_promotions` | Time-sensitive copy angles, CTA variations |
| `landing_pages` | Copy must match the page or conversions drop |

## Persona-Informed Copy

Cross-reference `{data_dir}/personas/{accountId}.json` (created by `/ads-audit`) and `{data_dir}/business-context.json` to ground every piece of copy in real customer data.

### How personas shape copy decisions

| Persona Field | Copy Application |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `search_terms` | Use these exact words and phrases in headlines — they're the language real customers use |
| `pain_points` | Lead descriptions with the pain point, then present the solution. Pain > features for click-through |
| `decision_trigger` | This IS your CTA angle. If the trigger is "seeing reviews mentioned", put the review count in a headline |
| `primary_goal` | Match H1 to this goal. The first headline should answer "will this page help me do X?" |
| `demographics` | Adjust register: corporate buyer gets different language than homeowner. Technical user gets specs, consumer gets benefits |

### Persona-to-headline mapping

For each ad group, identify which persona(s) it serves:
1. Look at the ad group's keywords and match to persona `search_terms`
2. Write H1 using the persona's `primary_goal` language
3. Write value prop headlines using the persona's `pain_points` (solution framing)
4. Write CTA using the persona's `decision_trigger`

If an ad group serves multiple personas (common in broad campaigns), create separate ad variants — one optimized per persona — and A/B test which performs better.

## Ad Strength vs Actual Performance

Google's ad strength score optimizes for Google's internal ad diversity goals, not your conversion rate. Treat it as a secondary signal, never a primary optimization target.

### The hierarchy (most to least important)

1. **Conversion rate** — does the ad produce customers?
2. **CTR** — does the ad get clicks from the right people?
3. **CPA** — what does each conversion cost?
4. **Ad strength** — does Google think there's enough variety?

### Specific rules

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Excellent" ad strength, CTR < 2% | Ad strength is misleading. The headlines are varied but not compelling. Rewrite for relevance over diversity |
| "Good" ad strength, CTR > 5% | Do not touch this ad to chase "Excellent". The ad is working. Ad strength is a vanity metric here |
| "Poor" ad strength, CTR > industry avg | Add more headline/description variety to satisfy Google's diversity requirement, but don't change the winning headlines |
| "Poor" ad strength, CTR < industry avg | Both signals agree — the ad needs a rewrite. Start with headline relevance to keywords |
| Ad strength drops after headline edit | If CTR improved, ignore the ad strength drop. If CTR also dropped, revert |

### When ad strength IS useful

- Ensuring you have 8+ distinct headlines (not minor variations of the same message)
- Ensuring at least 1 headline per category (service, value prop, trust, CTA)
- Flagging when all descriptions say the same thing in different words
- Catching missing keyword insertion opportunities

## Competitive Differentiation

Read `{data_dir}/business-context.json` `competitors` and `differentiators` fields. If empty, infer competitors from auction overlap (high impression share keywords where rank-lost IS is elevated suggest active competitors).

### Rules for competitive copy

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| NEVER name competitors in ad copy | Policy violation risk with Google Ads. Also sends brand awareness to competitors. Even "Better than [Competitor]" is dangerous |
| NEVER use "best" or "#1" without qualification | Google requires substantiation for superlative claims. "Best-Rated on Google" is OK if verifiable. "Best Plumber" is not |
| DO use specific features competitors lack | "Same-Day Service" beats "Better Service". Specificity implies superiority without claiming it |
| DO use pricing advantage if real | "Flat-Rate Pricing" or "From $99" differentiates against competitors with opaque pricing |
| DO use trust signals aggressively | "25+ Years", "4.9★ Google Rating", "500+ 5-Star Reviews" — these are verifiable and powerful |
| DO use location specificity | "Seattle's Own [Service]" or "Locally Owned Since 1998" differentiates against national chains |
| DO use speed/convenience | "Same-Day", "24/7", "Book Online in 60 Seconds" — operational advantages competitors may not match |
| DO use guarantees | "Satisfaction Guaranteed", "Free Re-Service", "No Fix, No Fee" — risk reversal converts |

### Differentiation angle selection

Based on the competitive landscape, choose the strongest angle:

| Business Situation | Best Differentiation Angle | Example Headline |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Competing against national chains | Local ownership, personal service, community ties | "Family-Owned Since 2005" |
| Competing against cheaper alternatives | Quality, guarantees, reviews, expertise | "Licensed & Insured Pros" |
| Competing against premium alternatives | Value, transparent pricing, same quality for less | "Premium Service, Fair Prices" |
| Unique service offering | The specific feature itself | "Same-Day Emergency Visits" |
| Crowded market, no clear advantage | Speed, convenience, or customer experience | "Book Online — Arrive in 1hr" |

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the brief

Detect or ask:
- What product/service is this ad for?
- Target audience or segment?
- Which campaign/ad group? (pull with `listCampaigns` → `listAdGroups`)
- Landing page URL?
- Any geographic targeting?

Cross-reference against the business context — if the user says "write copy for boarding" and context has boarding details, you already know the angles.

### 2. Research what's working

Pull data before writing — copy should be grounded in what converts, not guesses.

**Current ad performance (use GAQL for multi-campaign research, see `../shared/gaql-cookbook.md`):**

If the user specified a single campaign/ad group, use helper tools directly. If researching across campaigns (common for brand-wide copy refresh), use GAQL:
- GAQL "Ad copy" query → existing headlines/descriptions and their metrics across all campaigns
- GAQL "Keywords with QS" query → active keywords and what's converting
- GAQL "Search terms" query → actual user queries (reveals real language and intent)
- GAQL "Impression share" query → CTR/conversion benchmarks to beat

For single-campaign work, the per-campaign helpers are simpler:
- `listAds(campaignId)` — existing headlines/descriptions
- `getKeywords(campaignId)` — active keywords
- `getSearchTermReport(campaignId)` — actual user queries
- `getCampaignPerformance(campaignId)` — CTR benchmarks

**Use seasonality context.** If business context shows peak months, factor that into copy urgency. During slow months, lean on evergreen value props. During peaks, lean on scarcity and timeliness.

**Use keyword landscape context.** For competitive terms (high CPC, many bidders), copy must differentiate harder — lead with what's unique, not what everyone says. For long-tail terms, match the specific intent closely.

**If the user has a database with lead/conversion data**, query it to find which keywords and messaging actually convert. The language paying customers use is the language your ads should mirror.

### 3. Generate RSA components

Google RSA: up to **15 headlines** (30 chars max) and **4 descriptions** (90 chars max). Google's AI mixes and matches them.

**Always count characters. Flag any that exceed limits. A single character over = rejected by Google.**

#### Headline & Description Formulas

See `references/rsa-best-practices.md` — Headline Formula Table (27 formulas across 8 categories) and Description Formula Table (5 formulas). Use those as the source of truth for all copy generation.

**Headline selection rules:**
- Generate 3-4 headlines per category for a total of 12-15
- Pin 1 Service+Location headline to Position 1 (highest relevance impact)
- Pin 1 CTA headline to Position 3 (Google shows H3 less often — make it count when shown)
- Leave Position 2 unpinned to let Google test Value Prop, Trust, and Differentiator headlines
- Never pin more than 3 headlines total — over-pinning reduces Google's optimization ability

**Description selection rules:**
- Always generate 4 descriptions (the RSA maximum)
- D1 should be the strongest all-around description (core value + location) — it shows most often
- D2 should emphasize the primary differentiator
- D3 should lead with trust/social proof
- D4 should be seasonal or offer-based (swap this out when promotions change)
- Every description must end with a CTA verb: Call, Book, Get, Schedule, Request, Visit, Contact
- Character count is STRICT: 90 chars max. Measure before finalizing. It's better to be 85 chars and punchy than 90 chars and cramped

### 4. Present variants

Show 2-3 variants, each with a distinct messaging angle. Name the angle so it's clear what's being tested.

```
VARIANT A: "[Angle Name — e.g., Trust & Experience]"
  Target persona: [persona name from {data_dir}/personas/]
  H1 [Pin 1]: [Service] in [Location]       (XX chars)
  H2: [Value prop headline]                  (XX chars)
  H3: [Trust headline]                       (XX chars)
  H4: [CTA headline]                         (XX chars)
  ... (up to 15 headlines)
  D1: [Core value + location — max 90 chars] (XX chars)
  D2: [Differentiator + CTA — max 90 chars]  (XX chars)
  D3: [Trust + proof — max 90 chars]         (XX chars)
  D4: [Urgency/offer — max 90 chars]         (XX chars)

VARIANT B: "[Different Angle — e.g., Price & Value]"
  Target persona: [persona name]
  H1 [Pin 1]: ...
  ...
```

Always show character counts. Always show pin positions. Always name the target persona.

**Variant differentiation rules:**
- Each variant must test a meaningfully different angle — not minor word swaps
- Good test: "Trust & Expertise" vs "Speed & Convenience" vs "Price & Value"
- Bad test: "Call Today" vs "Call Now" vs "Call Us" (not different enough to learn from)
- If the account has multiple personas, create one variant per persona

### 5. Deploy

After user approves a variant, push it live:

- **New ad:** `createAd` — create the RSA in the target ad group (created paused)
- **Update existing:** `updateAdAssets` — replace headlines/descriptions on a live ad
- **Enable when ready:** `enableAd`

Always confirm before any write operation. Note the `changeId` returned — user can undo within 7 days (if the entity hasn't been modified since) via `undoChange`.

(Call tools under the MCP prefix detected by the shared preamble — do not hardcode `mcp__adsagent__`.)

### 6. A/B test (if running one)

1. **Identify the variable** — messaging angle, CTA style, emotional vs. practical
2. **Deploy both variants** as separate ads in the same ad group (both paused, enable together)
3. **Minimum run:** 2 weeks or 100 clicks per variant, whichever comes first
4. **Success metric:** CTR for awareness campaigns, conversion rate for bottom-funnel

**Statistical significance rules:**
- Do not call a winner with <100 clicks per variant — the data isn't reliable
- A "winner" needs at least 20% relative CTR or conversion rate difference to be meaningful
- If the difference is <20% after 200+ clicks each, the variants are functionally equivalent — pick the one with better conversion rate, or run a bolder test
- If one variant has 2x+ the conversion rate, call it immediately — don't wait for click minimums

### 7. Check results

After the test period, pull results:

```
listAds → compare metrics for each variant
```

| Variant | Impressions | Clicks | CTR | Conversions | Conv Rate | CPA | Winner? |
|---------|------------|--------|-----|-------------|-----------|-----|---------|
| A       |            |        |     |             |           |     |         |
| B       |            |        |     |             |           |     |         |

**Interpretation matrix:**

| CTR | Conv Rate | Diagnosis | Action |
|-----|-----------|-----------|--------|
| A higher | A higher | Clear winner | Pause B. Iterate on A's angle with fresh headlines |
| A higher | B higher | A attracts more clicks but B converts better | Keep B as primary. Test A's headlines on B's landing page — the click-through message may need landing page alignment. Offer `/ads-landing` |
| Similar | Similar | No meaningful difference | Need a bolder test — the variants were too similar. Change the core messaging angle, not just word choice |
| Both low | Both low | Neither variant works | The problem isn't A vs B — it's the overall approach. Check: keyword intent match, landing page quality, offer strength. May need `/ads-audit` to diagnose |

After deciding a winner: pause the loser with `pauseAd`, keep the winner running. Then create a new variant to test against the winner — continuous improvement, never stop testing.

## Rules

1. **Business context first.** Read `{data_dir}/business-context.json` before doing anything. If it doesn't exist, build it.
2. **Research before writing.** Always pull current performance data. Don't write copy in a vacuum.
3. **Character limits are hard.** Count every headline (<=30) and description (<=90). No exceptions. When in doubt, count again.
4. **Never deploy without confirmation.** Show the exact copy, get a yes, then create/update.
5. **Note changeIds.** Every write returns one. Tell the user they can undo within 7 days (if the entity hasn't been modified since).
6. **Ground copy in conversion data.** If conversion data is available, use the language that converts. Customer language > marketing language.
7. **Seasonal awareness.** Check the business context for peak/slow months. Adjust urgency and messaging accordingly.
8. **Defer to /ads for account management.** This skill writes copy and deploys ads. For bid/budget/keyword work, use `/ads`.
9. **Personas over guesses.** If personas exist, every headline should trace back to a persona's language or triggers. If they don't exist, recommend `/ads-audit` to build them.
10. **Differentiate, don't imitate.** Read the competitors field and write copy that stands apart. Generic copy that could belong to any competitor is a waste of an ad slot.
